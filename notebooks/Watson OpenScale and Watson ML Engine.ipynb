We must also provide the number of records OpenScale will use to calculate the fairness score. In this case, OpenScale's fairness monitor will run hourly, but will not calculate a new fairness rating until at least 200 records have been added. Finally, to calculate fairness, OpenScale must perform some calculations on the training data, so we provide the dataframe containing the data.",

Click on the timeseries graph to get detailed information on transactions during a specific time window.\n\n## Next steps\n\nOpenScale shows model performance over time. You have two options to keep data flowing to your OpenScale graphs:\n  * Download, configure and schedule the [model feed notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emartensibm/german-credit/master/german_credit_scoring_feed.ipynb). This notebook can be set up with your WML credentials, and scheduled to provide a consistent flow of scoring requests to your model, which will appear in your OpenScale monitors.\n  * Re-run this notebook. Running this notebook from the beginning will delete and re-create the model and deployment, and re-create the historical data. Please note that the payload and measurement logs for the previous deployment will continue to be stored in your datamart, and can be deleted if necessary.",
